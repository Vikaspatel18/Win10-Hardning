| **Enhancing Security vs. Maintaining Availability** | Enhancing security often reduces system availability.                     | Find a balance that suits your needs without hindering essential operations. |
| **Principle of Least Privilege**            | Users having more access than needed can increase ransomware risks.       | Assign minimal necessary privileges to secure data against unauthorized access. |
| **Outdated Software**                       | Neglecting regular updates can leave systems vulnerable.                  | Regularly update Windows and applications, including security patches. |
| **Unnecessary Programs and Features**       | Legacy features and unnecessary programs can introduce security risks.   | Disable or uninstall redundant features to minimize potential entry points for malware. |
| **Inadequate Windows Security Settings**    | Default security settings may not provide sufficient protection.          | Activate advanced security settings to strengthen defenses.            |
| **Autoplay and Network Visibility**         | Autoplay and visible network presence can be exploited.                   | Disable autoplay and ensure the computer is not discoverable.          |
| **Lack of Backups**                         | Without backups, data loss from attacks is inevitable.                    | Maintain regular backups using secure storage solutions.               |
| **Overlooking Security Measures**           | Failing to implement comprehensive security measures leaves systems vulnerable. | Employ a balanced approach to security, considering the environment's sensitivity. |
